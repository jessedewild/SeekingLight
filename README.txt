General:
- One seeker with a sword
- The maze is dark, there is a light around the character, the radians of the fog depends on monsters, coins and the star
- Coins around the maze, when you pick up a coin, a timer starts when the fog starts of small (you can see more of the maze), it slowly grows to the base position when the timer is lowering
- Monsters walk around the maze, when killed, the fog around your character grows, so you can see more of the maze
- One star in the map which will reveal the map for a certain amount of time
- You need to find the exit
